After a weekend of debugging, the issue was that my model could not handle the double that the Dataset provided, as it expected a float (but didn't give a warning, which seems a [PyTorch issue](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/is-it-required-that-input-and-hidden-for-gru-have-the-same-dtype-float32/96221)). \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a user I did not expect this bug. I have a `map` function that I call on the Dataset that looks like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndef preprocess(sentences: List[str]):\\r\\n    token_ids = [[vocab.to_index(t) for t in s.split()] for s in sentences]\\r\\n\\r\\n    sembeddings = stransformer.encode(sentences)\\r\\n    print(sembeddings.dtype)\\r\\n    return {\\\"input_ids\\\": token_ids, \\\"sembedding\\\": sembeddings}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven a list of `sentences` (`List[str]`), it converts those into token_ids on the one hand (list of lists of ints; `List[List[int]]`) and into sentence embeddings on the other (Tensor of dtype `torch.float32`). That means that I actually set the column \\\"sembedding\\\" to a tensor that I as a user expect to be a float32.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears though that behind the scenes, this tensor is converted into a **list**. I did not find this documented anywhere but I might have missed it. From a user's perspective this is incredibly important though, because it means you cannot do any data_type or tensor casting yourself in a mapping function! Furthermore, this can lead to issues, as was my case. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy model expected float32 precision, which I thought `sembedding` was because that is what `stransformer.encode` outputs. But behind the scenes this tensor is first cast to a list, and when we then set its format, as below, this column is cast not to float32 but to double precision float64.\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndataset.set_format(type=\\\"torch\\\", columns=[\\\"input_ids\\\", \\\"sembedding\\\"])\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis happens because apparently there is an intermediate step of casting to a **numpy** array (?) **whose dtype creation/deduction is different from torch dtypes** (see the snippet below).  As you can see, this means that the dtype is not preserved: if I got it right, the dataset goes from torch.float32 -> list -> float64 (numpy) -> torch.float64. \\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport torch\\r\\nimport numpy as np\\r\\n\\r\\nl = [-0.03010837361216545, -0.035979013890028, -0.016949838027358055]\\r\\ntorch_tensor = torch.tensor(l)\\r\\nnp_array = np.array(l)\\r\\nnp_to_torch = torch.from_numpy(np_array)\\r\\n\\r\\nprint(torch_tensor.dtype)\\r\\n# torch.float32\\r\\nprint(np_array.dtype)\\r\\n# float64\\r\\nprint(np_to_torch.dtype)\\r\\n# torch.float64\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis might lead to unwanted behaviour. I understand that the whole library is probably built around casting from numpy to other frameworks, so this might be difficult to solve. Perhaps `set_format` should include a `dtypes` option where for each input column the user can specify the wanted precision.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alternative is that the user needs to cast manually after loading data from the dataset but that does not seem user-friendly, makes the dataset less portable, and might use more space in memory as well as on disk than is actually needed.\",\n          \"Code:\\r\\n`dataset = load_dataset('ms_marco', 'v2.1')`\\r\\n\\r\\nError:\\r\\n```\\r\\n`---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nJSONDecodeError                           Traceback (most recent call last)\\r\\n<ipython-input-16-34378c057212> in <module>()\\r\\n      9 \\r\\n     10 # Downloading and loading a dataset\\r\\n---> 11 dataset = load_dataset('ms_marco', 'v2.1')\\r\\n\\r\\n10 frames\\r\\n/usr/lib/python3.6/json/decoder.py in raw_decode(self, s, idx)\\r\\n    353         \\\"\\\"\\\"\\r\\n    354         try:\\r\\n--> 355             obj, end = self.scan_once(s, idx)\\r\\n    356         except StopIteration as err:\\r\\n    357             raise JSONDecodeError(\\\"Expecting value\\\", s, err.value) from None\\r\\n\\r\\nJSONDecodeError: Unterminated string starting at: line 1 column 388988661 (char 388988660)\\r\\n`\\r\\n```\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
